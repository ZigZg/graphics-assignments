1. I compiled my code by cding into the build folder (using "cd build", if already in the starter4 folder) and running "make install" to compile the code. 

2. I collaborated briefly with Reese Rivera and Paige Grody, mainly for debugging issues.

3. I used cplusplus.com for C++ reference, as well as Stack Overflow for debugging unknown coding errors.

4. My code doesn't render the chicken in test #9, for some reason. I think the cause has to do with the camera rays not intersecting properly, and I planned on debugging it by isolating the chicken in its own .txt file and seeing what happened there. Also, texture mapping isn't exactly like in the sample solutions, although those are probably due to subtle bugs (incorrect equations, maybe).

5. No, I didn't do extra credit.

6. I had a lot of fun with this assignment! It took a while (about 20 hours), but it was still satisfying to actually render 3D models.
